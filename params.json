It's fully client-side (just some javascript files), so it can be hosted anywhere including Github.\r\n\r\nMoneypot even handles the bankroll. Profits are split between you, Moneypot, and Moneypot's investors. See: <https://www.moneypot.com/investment>.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/dTwOR01.png)\r\n\r\n## Run your own dice site\r\n\r\nIf you want to run your own dice casino, all you need to do is clone/fork this project, create an app at Moneypot (https://www.moneypot.com/apps/new), and set the `config.app_id` at the top of the `app.js` file.\r\n\r\n## Host it on Github\r\n\r\n1. Fork this project\r\n2. Rename the repository from `untitled-dice.github.io` to `{YOUR_USERNAME}.github.io`\r\n3. Edit the config at the top of `app.js`\r\n4.
